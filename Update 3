Added in some more global variables to make the program more user-friendly (name, date)
I played around with some of the print statements and made sure the information from the API was showing up properly.


import requests, json, pprint, datetime

myName = ''
stats = ''
date = ''

def intro(): #Makes the program more user friendly by giving an intro and asking for their name.

    global myName
    print('Hi! Welcome to COVID-19 tracker. During these tough times, we want to provide you with the most up to date information.')
    print ('Please introduce yourself, what is your name?')
    myName = input()

def PickACountry():

    global stats
    print(myName + ', please enter a country you would like to receive information regarding COVID-19.') #United States = US
    stats = input()
    URL = f'https://thevirustracker.com/free-api?countryTimeline={stats}'
    response = requests.get(URL)
    response.raise_for_status
    return response

def PickADate():

    global date
    print('This COVID-19 tracker is updated at the end of each day and thus the most recent information is for yesterdays date.')
    print('Please enter any date starting from the first reported COVID-19 case in the country you are seeking information about until yesterdays date.')
    print('For example if you are inquiring about the US: the first reported COVID-19 case was on 1/22/20...So you may enter any date between that and yesterdays date.')
    print('Enter the date you would like to receive information about.')
    print('Using this format: X/XX/XX.')
    date = str(input())

def getInfo(jsonData):

    coronaList = []
    coronaList.append(jsonData['countrytimelinedata'][0]['info']['title'])
    coronaList.append(jsonData['countrytimelinedata'][0]['info']['source'])
    coronaList.append(jsonData['timelineitems'][0][date])

    for x in range(len(coronaList)):
        print(coronaList[x])
        if x == 1:
            print('Please see the information regarding COVID-19 below for ' + date + ' in the ' + stats + ':')

intro()
response = PickACountry()
PickADate()
jsonData = json.loads(response.text)
getInfo(jsonData)
#pprint.pprint(jsonData)
